#adult.py

 - Requirements:
     - numpy
     - scikit-learn (which in turn requires scipy)
     - pydot2
     - matplotlib
     - pybrain
     - the [adult dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)
     - graphviz

I recommend using Anaconda as the environment on windows, optional on linux as well.  the dataset has been formatted as a csv with the first line being labels for each column.  You need both the .test and .data files for the code to run correctly, but it should parse everything successfully.
Used for Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, KNN, and decision trees without pruning.  Also graphing and visualizations.

#adult.java

 - Requirements:
     - weka (3-6 currently)

Used for decision trees and boosting with support for pruning
